* /Users/callum/work/Linden/viewer-tools-update-callum/indra/llcommon/llpredicate.h:144:17 trying to decipher correct code here.

* Missed off some #if LL_DARWINs around #pragmas to turn off non-useful warnings for OS X - will fix when build Windows viewer

* Remove explicity code to turn off unused funcs for tut.hpp (#pragma clang diagnostic ignored "-Wunused-function") - moved to package itself

* Port llQtWebKit with SSL3/TLS fix to hacked version and include in autobuild (Oz)

* Fix up commented out code in 'tut' package - tut/tut/tut_assert.hpp #82 & #84 (no operator << for T & Q)
