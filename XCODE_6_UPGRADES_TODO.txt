Weird folder name "build-darwin-i386/newview/$(CONFIGURATION)$(EFFECTIVE_PLATFORM_NAME)/Second Life.app" - likely causes because those $() should be ${} for CMake? - No, it's something else - lots of occurences in build-darwin folder but where do they come from? ....

libjpeg is placed in lib folder vs lib/release - change it to match others
