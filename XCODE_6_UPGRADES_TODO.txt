* Build with tests on (LL_TESTS:BOOL=ON) and fix

* Missed off some #if LL_DARWINs around #pragmas to turn off non-useful warnings for OS X - will fix when build Windows viewer

* Remove explicit code to turn off unused funcs for tut.hpp (#pragma clang diagnostic ignored "-Wunused-function") - I moved it to package itself

* Fix up commented out code in 'tut' package - tut/tut/tut_assert.hpp #82 & #84 (no operator << for T & Q)

* Fix llphysicsextension:
	* so it builds locally
	* remove unused variables 78-81
	* remove pointer to hacked version in vewer autobuild.xml

* Nat to look at this please: https://bitbucket.org/callum_linden/viewer-tools-update-callum/commits/3d2fb85943d527e7db9908ff2824bc54afe916f1

* Rebuild with CMake 3.0.2

* Remove -Wno-sign-compare from indra/cmake/00-Common.cmake and see if it builds.  (Why did this switched off still catch U32 v; if ( v < 0 ) {  })
